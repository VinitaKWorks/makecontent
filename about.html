        We love creating content, and we love supporting other content creators as well. Media production in America outside of Los Angeles and 
        New York is tough. This is why we formed this organization dedicated to gathering all kinds of independent media production crews. We gather crew 
        members for all kinds of media, from animations, to fictional films, to documentaries. Our goal is to help anyone pursue their media passions.
